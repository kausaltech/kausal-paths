  name_en: Congestion charge with redistribution
  description_en: This policy is about setting a congestion charge in the city center
    to reduce car driving. This policy has been extensively studied and it is known
    to be effective with fairly small social costs. However, it does affect disproportionally
    those poor people who have to move with an own car. Therefore, this policy includes
    the redistribution of the tax money back to citizens with an equal per-capitta
    amount. This overcompensates losses to poor people, because they typically spend
    less money on driving in absolute terms.
