  description: This module (all nodes upstream) is based on the excel sheets 1.0 - 1.4.2 Passenger trans. levers.
    Note! MIA = Model - inputs & assumptions, CDR = City data - Data requests.
    In the default datasets, I think we should have historical values for years 2018-2023.
    Then, the forecast values do not start before 2024 due to the defaults.

  description: 'TODO Data from Data 1&2 Tranportation, E174:AF179. TODO Upstream calculations based on Model inputs & 
    assumptions F194 and F207 needs to be included in the model. Emission factor is a weighted average existing and
    new car and bus fleet, where 0.5 * X % is renewed annually (X = city data request D47, share of fleet that is less than 2 years old). The current emission factors are asked from the user (City data request D34:D43) but the new
    emission factors come from data; the weighted average of the two trends is calculated.
    MATIAS: DO NOT START FROM HERE; emission fractions are still under construction.
    <p>FROZEN SCENARIO: Emission factors are constant across time.</p>
    <p>DIMENSIONS: pollutant (CO2, NOx, PM2.5, PM10 combustion and other). transport_mode (cars, buses, trains)</p>
    <p>Bus emission factor is calculated differently than cars, but the differences a minor and we attempt to apply uniform calculations. Cars are calculated by<br>=L174*(1-M$172)+M164*M$172<br>while buses are calculated by
    =IF(($L242*(1-SUM($L$241:N$241))+N233*SUM($L$241:N$241))>M242,M242,($L242*(1-SUM($L$241:N$241))+N233*SUM($L$241:N$241)))<br>
    There are a few key differences: 1) the existing fleet in the formula is that of year 2018, while with cars it is the previous year; 2) the percentage change is the total from 2018, while with cars it is from the previous year; 3) bus emission factor cannot increase, which would happen if the baseline emission factor (given by the user) would be larger than the new bus emission factor. There differences 1 & 2 are coherent, but it also results in a situation where the cohorts between 2019 and the previous year (inclusive) suddenly disappear and are replaced by current year fleet. However, this is not a problem because new bus fleet does not improve and the emission factors are the same for evary year. Difference 3 is handled (TODO!) by replacing the new emission factor with the baseline year value if it is smaller, so that at the actual calculation there is no need to consideer this any more.</p>'

    https://www.dieselnet.com/standards/eu/ld.php) TODO Implement as described below. Details of the NZC excel calculations are in Data - 1&2 Transportation!M174.<br>
    This node is needed in vehicle fleet upgrade. The idea is that there are several cohorts i of vehicles, each faving its own emission factor. The first cohort comes from node baseline_year_fleet_emission_factor and it contains all cars that were in the fleet in the baseline. Each year after that, a new cohort of cars enter the fleet, each having the emission factor that was for that year in node new_fleet_emission_factor. Each cohort has a proportion of P<sub>i</sub> among the fleet. The average emission factor is therefore<br>
    E<sub>t</sub> = sum<sub>i</sub>(E<sub>i,t</sub> * P<sub>i,t</sub>) <br>where i is class and t is timepoint. This is complicated by gradual removal of vehicle classes from the fleet such that<br>
    N<sub>i,t</sub> = N<sub>i,t0</sub> * product(s<sub>i,0</sub>, ..., s<sub>i,t</sub>), <br>where s<sub>i,t</sub> are the survival rates, N<sub>i,t</sub> is the number of cars in a cohort at timepoint t, t0 is the timepoint of entry for that cohort, and proportion P<sub>i,t</sub> = N<sub>i,t</sub>/sum<sub>i</sub>(N<sub>i,t</sub>).
    It must be noted that for each timepoint, there are the existing cohorts and a new cohort that enters in that year.</p>
    <p>In this use case, it is important to separate these cohorts becoause the emission factor is decreasing in time.
    The computation logic is that after a vehicle has entered the fleet, it has the same survival probability as all other
    cars in the fleet. (Not realistic but that is how NZC excel works)</p>
    Finally, we assume that E is constant for each vehicle as long as it is in the fleet. 
    This is handled by looking at each E<sub>i,t</sub> cohort until the last time point.'

  description: Particulate pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) are entered as totals by the user. However, calculations are based on a split between combustion pollutants (from tailpipe) and wear & tear (dust from breaks and tyres). This node has the fractions of these subcategories. Note! The NZC excel treats combustion and non-combustion fractions differently. Non-combustion value is taken from the user multiplied by its split fraction and assumed to stay constant across time. Combustion value for new cars comes from an EU report and is assumed to improve over time. The difference is substantial, as the default for current PM10 is 30 mg/vkm, while the new fleet assumes 8 mg/vkm. Here, we use the lower value, which is consistent with the calculation logic.
